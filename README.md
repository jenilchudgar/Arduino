## Description
In this folder, you will find simple Arduino code examples that utilize various sensors for different functionalities. Each sensor project focuses on a specific sensor and demonstrates its usage with an Arduino microcontroller board. The code provided here serves as a starting point and can be customized for specific applications or expanded upon to meet your project requirements.

## Components Used
The following components have been used in the sensor projects:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Various sensors (see individual project documentation for specific sensor details)
- Additional components as required by each sensor project

## Requirements
To use the Arduino code with these sensors, you need the following:

- An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
- The specific sensor(s) mentioned in the project descriptions
- Any additional hardware or components required by each sensor project
- Any software dependencies or libraries specified in each project's documentation

## Installation
Follow these steps to install and set up the code for the sensor projects:

1. Clone or download this folder to your local machine.
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Open the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) on your computer.
4. Locate the specific sensor project you want to work with in the downloaded folder.
5. Open the Arduino code file (.ino) associated with the sensor project in the Arduino IDE.
6. Make sure that the correct Arduino board is selected in the IDE's "Tools" menu.
7. Choose the appropriate port for your Arduino board in the "Tools" menu.
8. If any additional libraries are required, make sure to install them in the Arduino IDE using the library manager or by manual installation.
9. Click the "Upload" button in the IDE to compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.
